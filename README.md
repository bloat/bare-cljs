This is the smallest project I could make to run a browser connected
[ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) repl from
[Cider](https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the Emacs
Clojure(Script) IDE. The project uses the [Boot](http://boot-clj.com/)
build tool.

It is mostly based on information gleaned from the second edition of
[Modern CLJS](https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs) - the
excellent tutorial by Mimmo Cosenza.

Other information is from

* [Cider documentation](https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/up_and_running/#browser-connected-clojurescript-repl-in-boot-project)
* The [README](https://github.com/adzerk-oss/boot-cljs-repl/blob/master/README.md) for the boot cljs-repl plugin.
